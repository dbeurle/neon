# neon
A non-linear finite element code.  This project is still under development and is not considered stable.

## Building

Before using the package, the code needs to be compiled and installed on the local system.  There are two ways of accomplishing this task; using a docker image in a secure environment with the dependencies already handled, or compiling this on the host operating system.

### Docker

Go to the top level directory in the git repository and enter

- `sudo docker build -t neon .`

This will pull down the base image and then clone the git repository inside the docker container.  The original hosting can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/dbeurle/neon/

Once this is completed, enter the following commands to enter the docker container

- `$ sudo docker run -i -t neon /bin/bash`

The instructions in the section below can now be followed with the copy of the repository inside the docker container without worrying about dependencies.

### Linux

The external dependencies are:
 - Boost filesystem (to be replaced with `std::filesystem`)
 - Pastix and MUMPS for direct linear solvers
 - VTK for writing out simulation data to a ParaView compatible format
 - An OpenMP enabled C++17 compiler
 - Intel Thread Building Blocks TBB

Other dependencies are pulled in during build time with `CMake` and include

 - Eigen for linear algebra
 - range-v3 for range support
 - Termcolor for colour terminal support
 - Catch for unit testing

For best performance build with native optimisations on for the machine you are using.  This will automatically trigger Eigen to use wider SIMD instruction when available on native architecture at the expense of portability.

The build instructions for debug are
- `$ mkdir build && cd build/`
- `$ cmake ..`
- `$ make all`

and for release mode with optimisations

- `$ mkdir build && cd build/`
- `$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
- `$ make all -j<# cpus>`
- `$ sudo make install`

If the code is only used on a particular machine, then machine specification optimisations can be invoked by specifying the `CMake` symbol
- `-DENABLE_NATIVE=1`

which enables the compiler to generate the best machine code for your platform.

If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, then you can use the CUDA enabled iterative solvers by specifying the `CMake` symbol

- `-DENABLE_CUDA=1`

For checking the successful compilation of the program, invoke the test suite by executing

- `$ ctest`

in the build directory.

#### Ubuntu 18.04

Install dependencies through the package manager:

`$ sudo apt install cmake git mercurial zlib1g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libvtk6-dev libtbb-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libmumps-seq-dev libopenblas-dev libarpack2-dev libscotch-dev hwloc libhwloc-dev gfortran`

Then clone the repository and add

`$ git clone https://github.com/dbeurle/neon.git`

and enter the repository

`$ cd neon/docker && sh install_pastix.sh`

After this compiles and fails to install, enter the commands to install and link the libraries

`$ cd pastix_5.2.3/build && sudo make install && sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/libpastix.so /usr/lib/libpastix.so`

Provide the `sudo` password when prompted.

Now we are going to create the build directory and compile.  Navigate back to the `neon` directory and create and enter the `build` directory

`$ mkdir build && cd build`

We can create the compilation environment and setup optimisations using `CMake` with

`$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`

Finally compiling with

`$ make all -jN`

where `N` is the number of parallel build jobs you want to run.

You can then install using

`$ sudo make install`

and run the test suite with

`$ ctest`

to ensure the program is behaving as expected.
